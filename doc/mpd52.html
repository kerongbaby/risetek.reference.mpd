<p>An <b>event</b> is either the expiration of a timer, or the matching
of some pattern in the input.  Events that have not happened yet are
<b>pending events</b>. Pending events are created with the
<code>timer</code> and <code>match</code> commands, respectively.</p>
<p>Each pending event has an associated label (called the <b>target
label</b>) of the event. When and if the event occurs, execution
resumes starting at the target label. Events only occur during
the execution of a <code>wait</code> command.</p>
<p>Events are grouped into named <b>sets</b>. Events in the same
set are usually related, in the sense that they represent alternate
outcomes to the same situation.</p>
<p>A set of pending events may be explicitly <b>cancelled</b>
(i.e., forgotten) before they occur with the <b><code>cancel</code></b>
command. All events in the set are cancelled.</p>
<p>The other way a set of pending events may be cancelled is
implicitly, when any event in the set occurs. Execution resumes
at the target label associated with the event that occurred, and
all other events in that set are immediately cancelled.</p>
