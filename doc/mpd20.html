  <H2><A NAME="20"></A>4.3. Link layer<A NAME="links"></A></H2>
<p>This chapter describes commands that configure the link layer.
All of these commands apply to the currently active link, i.e.,
the link shown at the command line prompt.</p>
<p>
<dl>

<dt><b><code>set link action (bundle|forward) <em>name</em> [ <em>regexp</em> ]</code></b><dd>
<dt><b><code>set link action drop [ <em>regexp</em> ]</code></b><dd>
<p>List of such command describes how incoming calls should be processed.
"bundle" means that connection should be processed locally with
specified bundle. "forward" means that connection should be forwarded
using repeater to the specified link. "drop" means that connection
should be dropped. Optional "regexp" parameter defines regular
expression which will be checked against peer auth name.</p>
<p>Actions from list are checked in order of definition until regexp
match will be found. Actions processed at three points. First time
they are checked just after connection acception, second time just 
after receiving peer's auth during LCP negotiation and third time
when link is authenticated. As during first check there is no peer
auth name known yet, check will be skipped if there are more then 
one action specified for link or if action has regexp specified.</p>

<dt><b><code>set link action clear</code></b><dd>
<p>Clears link actions list.</p>

<dt><b><code>set link latency <em>microseconds</em></code></b><dd>
<dt><b><code>set link bandwidth <em>bits-per-second</em></code></b><dd>
<p>These commands are relevant when multi-link PPP is active.  They
affect the way in which packets are chopped up into fragments
before being sent over the various links that make up the bundle.</p>
<p>To motivate the idea, imagine a bundle that had a modem link and
a 1.5Mbps T1 link. If mpd sent each packet in two equal sized
fragments over these links, then by the time the modem got around
to transmitting the first byte of its fragment, the T1 link would
have probably already sent the whole other fragment. Clearly this
is not very good. By factoring in the latency and bandwidth parameters
for each link, mpd can distribute the fragments in a more intelligent
way.</p>
<p>Mpd attempts to distribute bytes over the links so that (if the
configured parameters are accurate) the last byte of each fragment
arrives at the peer at the same time on each link. This minimizes
latency. However, if you only care about maximizing throughput,
simply set all of the latency values to zero.</p>
<p>If all of your links are of the same type and speed (which is often
the case), then they should be configured with the same values (or
just not configured at all, since all links default to the same
values anyway). Then mpd will distribute packets in equal sized
fragments over the links.</p>

<dt><b><code>set link mtu <em>numbytes</em></code></b><dd>
<dt><b><code>set link mru <em>numbytes</em></code></b><dd>
<dt><b><code>set link mrru <em>numbytes</em></code></b><dd>
<p>The <code>set link mtu</code> command sets the maximum transmit unit
(MTU) value for the link.  This is the size of the largest single
PPP frame (minus PPP header) that this link will transmit, unless
the peer requests an even lower value. The default value is 1500 bytes.</p>
<p>The <code>set link mru</code> command sets maximum receive unit (MRU)
value for the link, which is the size of the largest single PPP frame
(minus PPP header) that this link is capable of receiving. The default
value is 1500 bytes.</p>
<p>If PPP multilink is negotiated on a link, then these values are
less important, because multilink allows PPP frames themselves to
be fragmented, so a PPP frame up to MRRU bytes can always pass
through no matter how small the MTU is in a particular direction.</p>
<p>Otherwise, mpd is responsible for making sure that the MTU configured
on the system networking interface is low enough so that the largest
transmitted IP packet does not exceed the peer's negotiated MRU after
it becomes a PPP frame. This includes e.g. PPP encryption and/or
compression overhead.</p>
<p>However, mpd does not account for overhead that occurs ``outside''
of the PPP frame. For example, when using link types such as PPTP
that encapsulate PPP frames within IP packets, a large outgoing
``inner'' IP packet can result in a fragmented ``outer'' IP packet,
resulting in suboptimal performance. In this situation it may be
useful to set the link MTU to a lower value to avoid fragmentation.</p>

<dt><b><code>set link accmap <em>value</em></code></b><dd><p>This sets the desired asynchronous control-character map for the
link at the local end.  This option is only relevant for the
asynchronous link types (i.e., <b>modem</b> and <b>tcp</b>).
It determines which control characters need to be escaped.</p>
<p>The <code><em>value</em></code> is expressed as a 32-bit hex
value; the default is <code>0x000a0000</code>, which escapes the
Control-S and Control-Q characters.</p>

<dt><b><code>set link ident <em>string</em></code></b><dd><p>This enables the sending of an identification string to the peer
via the LCP Ident code. The Ident string is sent when the link is
brought up. This is useful for debugging, etc. and is meant to be
human-readable. However, it confuses some broken PPP implementations.</p>
<p>Setting an empty string disables this feature; this is the default.</p>

<dt><b><code>set link fsm-timeout <em>seconds</em></code></b><dd><p>This command is analogous to the same command at the bundle layer,
but it applies to link-layer FSM's such as Link Control Protocol (LCP).
The default is two seconds; normally this value should not be changed.</p>

<dt><b><code>set link keep-alive <em>seconds</em> <em>max</em></code></b><dd><p>This command enables the sending of LCP echo packets on the link.
The first echo packet is sent after <code><em>seconds</em></code>
seconds of quiet time (i.e., no frames received from the peer on
that link).  After <code><em>seconds</em></code> more seconds, another
echo request is sent.  If after <code><em>max</em></code> seconds of
doing this no echo reply has been received yet, the link is brought
down.</p>
<p>If <code><em>seconds</em></code> is zero, echo packets are disabled.
The default values are five second intervals with a maximum no-reply
time of forty.</p>
<p>This feature is especially useful with modems when the carrier
detect signal is unreliable. However, in situations where lines are
noisy and modems spend a lot of time retraining, the <code><em>max</em></code>
value may need to be bumped up to a more generous value.</p>

<dt><b><code>set link max-redial <em>num</em></code></b><dd><p>When a link fails to connect, mpd automatically retries the connection.
This command limits the number of consecutive retries.
After <code><em>num</em></code> attempts, mpd will give up.</p>
<p>When there is another open event, new dial-on-demand traffic, etc.
mpd will try again, starting over at zero.</p>
<p>If <code>max-redial</code> is set to -1, then mpd will never redial.
This setting should be used with links that are dedicated for dial-in.</p>
<p>If <code>max-redial</code> is set to 0, then mpd will redial infinitely.</p>
<p>The default value is -1.</p>

<dt><b><code>set link redial-delay <em>seconds</em></code></b><dd><p>This command defines time between connection retries.</p>
<p>The default value is 1.</p>

<dt><b><code>set link max-children <em>num</em></code></b><dd><p>This template option specifies maximum number of links, created using
this template, that could exist at the same time. Value 0 disables template.</p>
<p>The default value is 10000.</p>

<dt><b><code>set link accept <em>option ...</em> </code></b><dd>
<dt><b><code>set link deny <em>option ...</em> </code></b><dd>
<dt><b><code>set link enable <em>option ...</em> </code></b><dd>
<dt><b><code>set link disable <em>option ...</em> </code></b><dd>
<dt><b><code>set link yes <em>option ...</em> </code></b><dd>
<dt><b><code>set link no <em>option ...</em> </code></b><dd>
<p>These commands configure various link options. Most options 
are <em>bi-directional</em> in that they can be independently
enabled and disabled in each direction.</p>
<p>The <code><b>enable</b></code> and <code><b>disable</b></code> commands determine
whether we want the corresponding option.
The <code><b>accept</b></code> and <code><b>deny</b></code> commands determine
whether we will allow the peer to request the corresponding option.</p>
<p>Note that when talking about the authentication options PAP and CHAP,
when you <code><b>enable</b></code> an option you're saying you are going
to require a login and password from the peer.
When you <code><b>accept</b></code> an option you're saying you will
allow the peer to require a login and password from us.</p>

<p>The <b><code>yes</code></b> command is the same as
<code><b>enable</b></code> and <code><b>accept</b></code>.
The <b><code>no</code></b> command is the same as
<code><b>disable</b></code> and <code><b>deny</b></code>.</p>

</dl>
</p>

<p>The options available at the link layer are:</p>
<p>
<dl>

<dt><b><code>pap</code></b><dd><p>PAP style authentication. Note that this style of authentication
is insecure, since the password crosses the link in plaintext.</p>
<p>Default <code><b>disable</b></code> and <code><b>accept</b></code>.</p>

<dt><b><code>chap</code></b><dd><p>CHAP style authentication. This style of authentication is safer
than PAP, because only a hash of the password is passed over the
link.  Mpd supports MD5 style CHAP and Microsoft style CHAP versions
1 and 2.  Mpd will prefer Microsoft CHAP over MD5 CHAP to get
encryption keys.</p>
<p>This option is an alias for <code>chap-md5</code> <code>chap-msv1</code> <code>chap-msv2</code></p>

<dt><b><code>chap-md5</code></b><dd><p>Traditional CHAP MD5 style authentication.</p>
<p>Default <code><b>disable</b></code> and <code><b>accept</b></code>.</p>

<dt><b><code>chap-msv1</code></b><dd><p>Microsoft CHAP style authentication.</p>
<p>Default <code><b>disable</b></code> and <code><b>deny</b></code>.</p>

<dt><b><code>chap-msv2</code></b><dd><p>Microsoft CHAP style authentication Version 2.</p>
<p>Default <code><b>disable</b></code> and <code><b>accept</b></code>.</p>

<dt><b><code>eap</code></b><dd><p>Extensible Authentication Protocol. For details see
<A HREF="mpd21.html#eap">the EAP chapter</A>.</p>
<p>Default <code><b>disable</b></code> and <code><b>accept</b></code>.</p>

<dt><b><code>incoming</code></b><dd><p>This option enables the acceptance of incoming connections.
If this option is disabled, mpd will not accept incoming connections
using this link. To avoid races it is advised to enable it after
all other link options are configured.</p>
<p>The default is <code><b>disable</b></code>.</p>

<dt><b><code>multilink</code></b><dd><p>This command enables multi-link PPP on the link. This option is required
in both directions if there is more than one link in the bundle. However,
multi-link PPP is sometimes useful on single links when the link MTU is
low; multi-link PPP allows arbitrarily long packets to go over a link
in fragments.</p>
<p>The default is <code><b>disable</b></code> (i.e., normal non-multilink PPP).</p>

<dt><b><code>shortseq</code></b><dd><p>This option is only meaningful if multi-link PPP is negotiated.
It proscribes shorter multi-link fragment headers,
saving two bytes on every frame.</p>
<p>The default is <code><b>enable</b></code> and <code><b>accept</b></code>.</p>

<dt><b><code>acfcomp</code></b><dd><p>Address and control field compression. This option only applies
to asynchronous link types. It saves two bytes per frame.</p>
<p>The default is <code><b>enable</b></code> and <code><b>accept</b></code>.</p>

<dt><b><code>protocomp</code></b><dd><p>Protocol field compression. This option saves one byte per frame
for most frames.</p>
<p>The default is <code><b>enable</b></code> and <code><b>accept</b></code>.</p>

<dt><b><code>magicnum</code></b><dd>
<dt><b><code>check-magic</code></b><dd><p>The <code>magicnum</code> option enables using a magic number for the
local end of the PPP link.  This causes a unique number to be
included in each LCP packet we send, which helps detect loopback
conditions.</p>
<p>The <code>check-magic</code> option causes mpd to verify that the peer's
magic number is correct in all received LCP frames.</p>
<p>Some old broken PPP implementations do not handle magic numbers correctly,
so these options need to be disabled in these cases.</p>
<p>Default for both options is <code><b>enable</b></code>.</p>
<p>Note that the two most common reasons for seeing ``loopback condition
detected'' on a modem link are:
<ul>
<li> The modem is in command mode and is echoing back all of our frames.</li>
<li> The PPP server is not in PPP mode, but is giving a shell prompt
or somesuch and echoing back all of our frames.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<dt><b><code>passive</code></b><dd><p>Enables passive mode for this link. This is useful on some full time
connections. See RFC 1661 for more information about this option.</p>
<p>Default <code><b>disable</b></code>.</p>

<dt><b><code>callback</code></b><dd><p>Enables PPP callback request. If the remote peer can/wants to, it will 
hangup immediately after connecting and call us back.</p>
<p>Default <code><b>disable</b></code>.</p>

<dt><b><code>no-orig-auth</code></b><dd><p>Normally, if PAP or CHAP is enabled, we require the peer to
authenticate to us at the beginning of each connection. This option
temporarily disables this requirement if we are the one who originated
the connection and the peer rejects our request for a login.</p>
<p>This is useful when the same link is used for both dial-in and dial-out.</p>
<p>Default <code><b>disable</b></code>.</p>

<dt><b><code>keep-ms-domain</code></b><dd><p>Normally, if using MS-CHAP, the MS-Domain is stripped and only the plain
username is used. Under certain circumstances the MS-Domain should be kept,
for instance if IAS is used as RADIUS server.</p>
<p>Default <code><b>disable</b></code>.</p>

<dt><b><code>time-remain</code></b><dd><p>Send Time-Remaining LCP packet to the peer if AAA returned session timeout.</p>
<p>Default <code><b>disable</b></code>.</p>

<dt><b><code>peer-as-calling</code></b><dd><p>Forces mpd to send remote tunnel address in Calling-Station-Id 
instead of address supplied by remote peer via tunnel (for PPTP and L2TP).
Can be enabled for untrusted peers.</p>
<p>Default is <code><b>disable</b></code>.</p>

<dt><b><code>report-mac</code></b><dd><p>Forces mpd to send peer MAC address and interface in Calling-Station-Id.</p>
<p>Default <code><b>disable</b></code>.</p>
