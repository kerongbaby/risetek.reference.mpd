  <H2><A NAME="32"></A>4.11. Dynamic Authorization<A NAME="dynauth"></A></H2>

<p>After session has been first time authorized by AAA subsystem,
Mpd provides you several ways to affect it's further operation.
Process of affecting established session called dynamic authorization.</p>
<p>There are two types of dynamic authorization activities exist:
Disconnect (terminate session, causing it's graceful shutdown)
and Change of Authorization, CoA (changing session operation
parameters, such as speed, ACLs and so on, on-flight)</p>
<p>
<dl>
<p>Mpd provides several different control interfaces, that can be used
to implement dynamic authorization.</p>

<dt><b>Control consoles</b><dd><p>The basic method of controlling mpd is it's STDIN and TCP
<b>
<A HREF="mpd40.html#console">consoles</A></b>.</p>
<p>You can disconnect any session by connecting to console, selecting
required session with any command for changing current context, such
as: <em>link</em>, <em>bundle</em>, <em>session</em>, <em>msession</em>
and so on, and using <em>close</em> command.</p>

<dt><b>Web server</b><dd><p>Mpd provides two <b>
<A HREF="mpd41.html#web">Web</A></b> interfaces:
human (text/html) and binary (text/plain).</p>
<p>Human web interface allows you disconnect specified session just by
clicking on respective <em>[Close]</em> link on the
"Current status summary" web page on mpd built-in web server.</p>
<p>Binary web interface provides API for executing any of control console
commands via HTTP request. For example, to disconnect session on
link named L125 you may use such HTTP request:
<em>/bincmd?link%20L125&amp;close</em></p>

<dt><b>RADIUS accounting</b><dd><p>Mpd provides simple, but non-standard method of disconnecting session
using <b>
<A HREF="mpd30.html#radius">RADIUS</A></b> accounting reply.
To disconnect arbitrary session you may just include <em>mpd-drop-user</em>
attribute with nonzero value into any accounting reply packet.</p>
<p>This method considered not to be completely reliable, as AAA receives
no acknowledge that accounting reply packet was received by mpd. The
only thing guarantied, is that on packet loss mpd will retry accounting
sending for specified number of times before giveup.</p>

<dt><b>Built-in RADIUS server</b><dd><p>RFC 3576: "Dynamic Authorization Extensions to RADIUS" defines standard
way to implement dynamic authorization. It defines two additional RADIUS
request types: Disconnect-Request and CoA-Request, to be sent from AAA
server to dedicated UDP port on NAS with regular RADIUS protocol.</p>
<p>To have this function working, mpd should be built with <em>libradius</em>
library, having RADIUS server functionality (FreeBSD 7/8-STABLE after
2009-10-30).</p>
<p>This chapter describes commands that configure mpd's built-in RADIUS
server. All of these commands are executed in global context.</p>
<p>
<dl>

<dt><b><code>set radsrv open</code></b><dd><p>Opens the RADIUS server, i.e., creates the listening UDP socket.</p>

<dt><b><code>set radsrv close</code></b><dd><p>Closes the RADIUS server, i.e., closes the listening UDP socket.</p>

<dt><b><code>set radsrv self <em>ip</em> [ <em>port</em> ]</code></b><dd><p>Sets the credentials for the RADIUS-listener. After changing one of these
options, the RADIUS server  must be closed and re-opened for the changes to
take effect.</p>
<p>The default is '0.0.0.0 3799'.</p>

<dt><b><code>set radsrv peer <em>ip</em> <em>secret</em></code></b><dd><p>Defines additional AAA server, allowed to contact this NAS. After changing
one of these options, the RADIUS server  must be closed and re-opened for
the changes to take effect.</p>

<dt><b><code>set radsrv enable <em>option ...</em><br>
set radsrv disable <em>option ...</em></code></b><dd><p>These commands configure various RADIUS server options.</p>

<p>The <code><b>enable</b></code> and <code><b>disable</b></code> commands determine
whether we want the corresponding option.</p>
<p>The options available for the RADIUS server are:</p>

<dt><b><code>coa</code></b><dd><p>This option enables CoA-Request support on RADIUS server.</p>
<p>The default is enable.</p>

<dt><b><code>disconnect</code></b><dd><p>This option enables Disconnect-Request support on RADIUS server.</p>
<p>The default is enable.</p>

</dl>

Dynamic authorization RADIUS server receives three groups of attributes:
NAS identification (to be sure that request got to the right server),
session identification (to identify session that should be affected)
and session parameters (to describe new session state to set).
NAS and session identification attributes are native part of any
Disconnect or CoA request, while session parameters could be used only
with CoA. At least one session identification attribute must be present
in request. If there are several identification attributes present,
session should match all of them to be affected.</p>
<p>NAS identification attributes supported by mpd:
<pre>
N   Name
4   NAS-IP-Address
</pre>
</p>
<p>Session identification attributes supported by mpd:
<pre>
N   Name
1   User-Name
5   NAS-Port
8   Framed-IP-Address
30  Called-Station-Id
31  Calling-Station-Id
44  Acct-Session-Id
50  Acct-Multi-Session-Id

    mpd VSA (12341)
12  mpd-link
13  mpd-bundle
14  mpd-iface
15  mpd-iface-index
</pre>
</p>
<p>Session parameters attributes supported by mpd:
<pre>
N   Name
24  State
25  Class
27  Session-Timeout
28  Idle-Timeout
85  Acct-Interim-Interval

    mpd VSA (12341)
1   mpd-rule
2   mpd-pipe
3   mpd-queue
4   mpd-table
5   mpd-table-static
7   mpd-filter
8   mpd-limit
16  mpd-input-acct
17  mpd-output-acct
</pre>
</p>
<p>Received in CoA session parameters replace existing ones. If some parameter
is not received, it keeps it's previous value for standard attributes,
and getting cleared for mpd's VSAs.</p>
<p>Note that CoA request always restarts Session and Idle timers for matching
interfaces, and restarts Accounting Update timer for matching links, if new
value received.</p>
