  <H2><A NAME="14"></A>3.2.3. <code>mpd.secret</code></H2>
<p>This file contains login, password pairs, one entry per line.
Each entry may have an optional third argument, which is
an IP address with optional netmask width. This is used
when negotiating IP addresses with the corresponding peer.
We restrict the allowable IP addresses we'll assign to the
peer to lie within the specified range.</p>
<p>In the example below, we define two ISP accounts that we
use to connect to the Internet. Also, we have three friends
who are allowed to connect to us, and we want to restrict
the IP addresses that we'll let them have. Finally, the last
user's password is retrieved by an external program.
<blockquote><code>
<pre>
#
# mpd.secret configuration file
#

# my two ISP accounts
mylogin1    password1
mylogin2    "Xka \r\n"

# my three friends
bob         "akd\"ix23"   192.168.1.100
jerry       "33dk88kz3"   192.168.1.101
phil        "w*d9m&amp;_4X"   192.168.1.128/25

# An external password access program
gregory     "!/usr/local/etc/mpd/get_passwd.sh"
</pre>
</code></blockquote>

Here <code>bob</code> and <code>jerry</code> must negotiate 
<code>192.168.1.100</code> and <code>192.168.1.101</code>,
respectively, while <code>phil</code> can ask for any
address from <code>192.168.1.128</code> through <code>192.168.1.255</code>.</p>
<p>The leading ``!'' means that the password for user <code>gregory</code> is not
stored in the <code>mpd.secret</code> file directly.  Instead, the
named program is run with the username being authenticated as an
additional argument (so in this case the command line would be
``<code>/usr/local/etc/mpd/get_passwd.sh gregory</code>''). The command string
may include initial, fixed arguments as well. This program
should print the plaintext password for the named user as a
single line to standard output, and then exit.  <code>Mpd</code> will block
for this operation, so the program should respond and exit quickly.
If there is an error, the command should print an empty line, or just not
print anything.</p>
<p>As a special case, if the username in the <code>mpd.secret</code> file
is ``*'', then this line must be last as it matches any username.
Then it is up to the external program to determine whether the
username is valid. This wildcard matching only works for ``!'' lines.</p>
<p>The total length of the executed command must be less than 128
characters.  The program is run as the same user who runs
<code>mpd</code>, which is usually <code>root</code>, so the usual
care should be taken with scripts run as root, e.g., make sure the
script is not world-readable or world-writable.  Standard input and
standard error are inherited from the parent <code>mpd</code> process.
Note that any additional arguments will be visible to users on the
local machine running <code>ps(1)</code>.</p>
